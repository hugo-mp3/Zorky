Verbose -- You can turn on and off Verbose mode
by using "verbose true|false"
This will turn on/off a mode that prints
all the exits to a room when entering
ie. with Verbose mode ofgf, it makes the game harder
by not telling you where you can go and you need to
extrapolate that information from the room desriptions
------------------------------------------------------
Lockable Exits -- a feature where exts can spawn locked
exits will have the chance to be locked when the game is started
this happens when they have a key item attached to them
that will allow them to open
in sampleDungeon.zork the only exit out of the starting room
is locked, until you pick up the GoldenKey, the n exit's key item,
and it opens for the rest of the game and persistantly stays open
through save files
