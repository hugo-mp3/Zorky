Rooms:
Rotunda
You are in a beautiful round entry chamber, with tall white pillars that
seemingly reach to the skies. There is an elevator here.
---
Basement hallway
Contents: DrPepper
A long, white hallway stretches to the east and west. It is cold here, and you
can detect the faint smell of body odor. A vending machine hums softly in the
corner.
---
Back hallway
Comfortably cool, this hallway features stylish lines and cutting-edge decor.
---
Stephen's office
Contents: StarWarsToy,WawaTravelMug,donut
This is a cluttered office, with many geeky toys sprawling on a desk. There
are posters of Dune, Star Wars, and UMW Women's Basketball on the walls.
---
Room 054
Sunlight streams through tall windows and illuminates a brilliant classroom.
---
Lab
The scent of unwashed bodies is stronger in this place. Rows of
state-of-the-art computers line the room, with happy young people typing
merrily away at several of them. They look up and wave hello to you.
The door locks behind you.
---
Rotunda balcony
Contents: chainsaw,magicWand
You stand on a circular white balcony overlooking an entry hall.
Columnar bannisters in ancient Grecian style stand between you and the
precipice.
