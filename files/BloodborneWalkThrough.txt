Welcome to Bloodborne!
You have come from a far land to recieve blood ministration to attampt to alleviate your sickness.
When you start you find yourself in Iosefka's Clinic
after picking up the note and wandering outside, you find yourself in Central Yharnam
proceding to the Tomb of Oedon, you can find a key to open the locked gater above
The world now splits off from here in Cathedral Ward and you can explore the many ends of this city
Going east to the Grand Cathedral you can find a Vicar's note, we need this to progress
going back west to Cathedral Ward, we can now go north through the once gaurded door as we now how the proff needed to progress
from here the dungeon splits agian, going up to Upper Clinic Sickroom will loop us back to where we started
but, going east we will end up the ther Forbidden Grave
continuing further east, you will end up in Byrgenwerth
going north from here and into the lake we will find our next progression item, a tonsil stone from the large spider-thing
going all the way back to Cathedral Ward, we can head to the Grand Cathedral and head right/south
Now you are in Yahar'gul the Unseen Village
continue south into the Chapel
from here go down into the courtyard and pick up the caged head, this is how we can progress
going south through the plaza we will find ourselves in the Nightmare of Mensis with no way back
continue up Mergo's Loft and pick up Micolash's key
then continue upwards into the Lunarium
then we can go further upwards into the Hunter's Dream
here we find a NewBornOldOne, most likely the one who made this world how it is today
once you pick up the NewBornOldOne you win the game!
CONGRATULATIONS!!
ps. i had to take some liberties with how stuff was laid out and interacted
