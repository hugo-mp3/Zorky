When you start the game, you will find yourself in a Mossy room
in this room, ther is one exit, to the north
if you try to move through it, you will find that you cannot
but you can pick up the GoldenKey in the room and it will now open
In the next room is a throne and a stack of papers
upon examining the throne you will find that there is a striking resemblance to something we all know and love
you can even pull the lever that is on the throne and something interesting will happens
once you are done having fun you can sit on the throne and win the game
